**‚öôÔ∏èSteps Taken to Build the Dashboard**
1.	Data Cleaning and Transformation (Power Query): 
  a.  Removed duplicates, handled null values.
  b.  Standardized date and numeric formats.
  c.  Created calculated columns:
      1.  TotalRevenue = OrderQuantity * ProductPrice,
      2.  TotalProfit = (ProductPrice - ProductCost) * OrderQuantity. .
      3.  FraudEncode = If(Fraud="True",0,1)
      4.  TransactionOrder = OrderQuantityProductPrice
      5.  TransactionwithNoFraud = FraudEncodeTransactionOrder
3.	Data Modeling: .
  a.  Star schema with one fact table and relevant dimension tables (e.g., Product Category, Country, Acquisition Source).
5.	DAX Measures Created:
       1.  PercentageTransactionwithNoFraud = sum(FraudEncode)/COUNT(FraudEncode)*100
7.	Visualization:
  a.  Bar charts, Donut charts, Line charts, Card KPIs, and interactive filters/slicers.
  b.  User-level interactivity with slicers for country, gender, fraud status, acquisition source, card type, and time filters.


**üîç Key Insights**
1.	Plants are the highest-performing product category, accounting for 93% of total profit.
2.	The United States and Australia generated the highest profits among all countries.
3.	Google Ads drives the most profitable and voluminous transactions.
4.	Only 4.66% of revenue is linked to fraud, indicating effective fraud control.
5.	Notable profit dip observed in late 2022, despite high order quantities.
6.	A few customers significantly impact revenue, suggesting high-LTV (lifetime value) users.


**üìåRecommendations**
1.	Product Strategy: Double down on Plants category through targeted promotions and bundled sales with low-performing categories like Pots.
2.	Customer Retention: Launch loyalty programs or exclusive offers for high-value repeat customers.
3.	Marketing Optimization: Allocate more budget to Google Ads, and investigate why Meta and YouTube campaigns underperform.
4.	Geographic Targeting: Increase inventory and campaign intensity in top regions (USA, Australia).
5.	Trend Monitoring: Investigate causes behind profit drop post-July 2022 (e.g., rising costs, seasonality, fraud spikes).
6.	Fraud Management: Maintain current fraud controls and continue monitoring, especially in Q3/Q4.
